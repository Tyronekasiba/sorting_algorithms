Hey there,
In this repository sorting aalogarithm is explained and demonstarated by the help of ALX task;


Here is all the mark down about the sorting alogarithm  and the big o notation

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list or array in a certain order. The order can be either ascending or descending. There are several sorting algorithms that exist, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some common sorting algorithms are Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It represents the worst-case scenario for an algorithm in terms of time complexity. Big O notation helps to estimate how the algorithm's time complexity will change as the input size increases.

In the context of sorting algorithms, the time complexity refers to the amount of time it takes to sort the elements of an array or list. The time complexity of a sorting algorithm is typically expressed using Big O notation. For example, Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means that the time it takes to sort an array of n elements grows quadratically as n increases. On the other hand, Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), which means that its time complexity grows much slower as n increases compared to Bubble Sort.

In summary, sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements of a list or array in a certain order, and Big O notation is used to describe the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm, which helps to estimate how the algorithm's performance will change as the input size increases.
